Overview
--------

This subject deals with the application of the science and engineering science that you have learned to the separation of chemical and biological mixtures. Specific processes considered will include distillation, membrane processes, chromatography and adsorption.

The object of the subject is twofold: to understand how separation work, and to further develop your ability to apply basic principles to the solution of specific problems.

Readings
--------

Reading assignments are listed in the syllabus. Additional reading assignments and handouts will be announced in class.

Assignments and Exams
---------------------

There will be approximately five problem sets over the course of the term. There will be two one-hour exams, one approximately mid term and the other during finals weeks. No exams will be dropped. Homework is the key to success here, despite the relatively low direct value in grade weighting. Without serious effort on the homework, the exams will be very difficult.

Cooperation among the student is encouraged within the following guidelines. Try the homework individually. If you get stuck, discuss it with your colleagues or the TAs or your instructors, and proceed individually. Individual effort is necessary for you to develop an effective problem solving strategy, which is essential to good exam performance and to succesful professional practice later on. Copying of another's homework is unacceptable.
